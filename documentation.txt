Tokenization
Sadece whitespace karakterlere göre ayırmak iyi bir çözüm değil. Url, hashtag, email adresleri özel. 
Çok kelimeli yapılar var alt kategori gibi New York gibi bunlar ayrılmadan bütün değerlendirilmeli.
Büşra'nın ı Büşra ve ' nın olarak ayıramazsın bir bütün. kesme işaretine dikkat. 
Fiyatı (45.53 TL) tarihi (01/02/2020) ayıramazsın 
virgül kullanışlı o varsa ayırabilirsin direkt
Sunumda bunlar anlatılıyor ama tokenizer için sadece boşlukla ayırma ve öncesinde bazı özel karakterleri silme yapılıyormuş her yerde öyle

Stopwords elimination ın ilk işlemi için:
Kelime listesini iki farklı kaynaktan topladık https://www.kaggle.com/tbrknt/detection-of-cyberbullying-in-turkish ve https://github.com/tkorkunckaya/Turkish-Stopwords/blob/master/stopwords/mongo/stop_words_turkish.txt
Dynamic approach of stopword elimination için:
One way is to look at word frequencies as a whole.
Calculate the frequency of all words in the combined texts. Sort them in falling order and remove the top 20% or so.
You may also wish to remove the bottom 5%. These are not stop-words, but for a lot of machine learning, they are inconsequential. Maybe even misspellings.

Sentence Splitting
Sentence splitting is also known as sentence boundary disambiguation (SBD), sentence breaking, sentence boundary detection, and sentence segmentation. 
It is the problem of deciding where sentences begin and end. NLP tools often require their input to be split into sentences. 
However, sentence splitting is quite difficult due to the potential ambiguity of punctuation marks. 
For example, in written languages, a full stop may show the end of the sentence, or may indicate an abbreviation (Dr.), a decimal point (5.259), an ellipsis (...), or an email address (com.tr). [1]

In order to verify the end of a sentence, the following methods are used.
1. If it's a full stop, it ends a sentence.
2. If the preceding token is in the hand-compiled list of abbreviations, then it doesn't end a sentence. [The list of the Turkish abbreviations exists in our GitHub repo.]
3. If the next token is capitalized, then it ends a sentence.

Using the list of languages abbreviations and the rules above, determining a strategy provides 95% accuracy. 
However, if there are some cases in the sentence such as "D. H. Lawrence", ".hack//SIGN" which are not identified in the list of abbreviations, the accuracy of sentence splitting fall under the remaining 5%.
